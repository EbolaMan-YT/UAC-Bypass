# UAC-Bypass
3 ways of bypassing admin restrictions/uac

# Bruteforce
1. run userbruteforce.bat
2. press 1 and choose your target
3. press 2 and enter your targets username
4. enter your password list (passlist.txt for default passlist)

NOTE: if it stops at a random attempt that means the password its on contains one of these characters: !><|^ (or another weird character), just delete that attempt from the file and restart

# Fake UAC Prompt

2. run main.vbs
3. hide the folder (to not be sus)

5. enjoy the admin cmd
